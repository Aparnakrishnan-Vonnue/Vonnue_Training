                    <h2>I pity the fool...</h2>
                    <p>Watching the news the other day, it occurred to me that people who have “words to live by” often begin to attack 
                       and even kill others. I thought back to my own angry youth, when I could easily use words to justify violent thoughts 
                       which might have become violent actions. Words are tools, and yet it seems that they can be more dangerous than gunpowder.
